# Welcome to Cookieless

Cookieless is a modern analytics platform that provides powerful insights without relying on traditional cookies. Our privacy-first approach ensures compliance with data protection regulations while delivering the analytics capabilities your business needs.

## What is Cookieless Analytics?

Traditional web analytics rely heavily on cookies to track user behavior across sessions and devices. However, with increasing privacy concerns and regulations like GDPR and CCPA, plus browser vendors phasing out third-party cookies, there's a growing need for cookieless solutions.

Cookieless analytics uses alternative tracking methods such as:

- **First-party data collection** - Leverage data you already own
- **Server-side tracking** - More reliable and privacy-compliant
- **Fingerprinting techniques** - Device and browser characteristics
- **Session-based analytics** - Focus on individual session insights
